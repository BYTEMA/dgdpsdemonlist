### List FAQ

How long will my record take to get accepted?

- It takes no more than a day or 2, if it is taking longer feel free to ping a demonlist staff as likely we have forgotten about the record, we are human keep in mund.

What do New record, update record, and fix record mean?

- new record is when your submitting a record for a level for the first time,
  update record is when you have a record on a level but you got a new best and
  it needs to be updated, fix record is when there is an issue with one of your
  records that needs to be fixed

What's an easy way to prove I don't hack?

- Show 2-5 seconds at the end of the previous attempt and the death of that
  attempt. This is the easiest way for us to verify you arent hacking/nocliping.
  However having click, fps counter or hand cam will help out a lot too

It's been like more than a week and my record still hasn't been added, what do i
do?

- You can ask us in
  [#list-support] (https://discord.com/channels/923026827281317919/1090186854269194383)
  , it was probably an accidentally deleted record(yes it happens), accidentally
  deleting the form, your name was mispelled or you were rejected for cheating

When will \_\_\_ be added to the list?

- Whenever we get enough opinions to place a level accurately. Normally doesn't take more than a week.

Can i submit Multiple levels on 1 video?
